# Verification Record

**Last verified: 2026-09-08**

How this repository proves it is right. The README states the standard in a
paragraph; this file holds the gate and the standing arguments behind it. What
each run found is on its tag's
[release page](https://github.com/andygeiss/baseline/releases); the run log that
lived here until v4.6.0 is in git history. It is written for whoever is about to
tag a release, or is auditing whether a rule was ever actually checked.

## What a review run is

A run has two halves, and a release needs both.

1. **The adversarial half.** Independent reviewers hunt cross-document
   contradictions, trace every canonical snippet's mechanics end to end, and
   check factual claims against upstream sources (Go, htmx, scs, SQLite). They
   repeat until **two consecutive passes find zero defects**. Reading is not
   enough on its own: every canonical Go snippet gets compiled and run through
   `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go fix -diff`, `staticcheck`, and `govulncheck`, the
   canonical `Makefile` runs end to end under GNU Make 3.81, the version macOS's
   Command Line Tools ship, and every measured color claim gets recomputed from its
   oklch values.
2. **The empirical half.** [baseline-reference](https://github.com/andygeiss/baseline-reference)
   implements the corpus end to end. It is synced to the change, and its
   `./verify.sh` runs every mechanical gate, then boots the real binary and
   smoke-tests the running application. This is the only half that catches rules
   that are each correct and do not compose.

The two halves catch different bugs. Document review found a stale
`X-Forwarded-For` fact (v3.0.0); only a running application would have found a rule
that contradicts another one nothing points at.

## The tag gate

**No tag ships until the first four are true, and no release is finished until the
fifth is.** This is a gate, not a goal.

1. Two consecutive adversarial passes over the changed documents find zero defects.
2. The reference implementation is synced to the change, and `./verify.sh` exits
   0 against the baseline commit its `SPEC.md` pins.
3. The reference's `SPEC.md` pins that commit and carries the four-field brief, and
   its own tag mirrors the baseline version.
4. **Nothing a project reads changed between the pinned commit and the tag.**
   `git diff --name-only <pin> <tag>` names this file and nothing else.
5. After the tag, its release page records the run, naming the reference release and
   the `verify.sh` result.

**Conditions 2 and 4 were one sentence until 2026-08-18, and it was one no release
could meet.** It read "`./verify.sh` exits 0 against the exact baseline commit
being tagged" — but the run record then lived in this file and named the reference
commit, so the tagged commit could never be the one the reference pinned. The order
now: the rules commit, the reference synced and tagged against it, the *Owed* section
cleared, the tag, then the release page.

**Every release met that gate in substance and none met it literally.** v3.6.0
through v3.9.0 each pinned a commit that is not the tagged one, and the whole
difference is this file, every time — v3.6.0's two commits have identical trees.
Condition 4 now checks that directly instead of demanding commit identity: the
rules the reference verified are the rules being tagged, which was always the
thing worth gating. It is one command, so it is checkable rather than assumed.

**A release note that says "the reference was not re-synced" is not a waiver —
it is an unfinished release.** That sentence appeared in two consecutive runs
before this gate existed, which is why the gate exists. If the reference cannot
be synced, the tag waits.

## Owed: changes not yet through a run

- **2026-09-22 — the run log left this file.** Run narratives now live on release pages
  only; README, the tag gate's condition 5, and the tombstone rule point there. The one
  project-facing edit: `VERSIONS.md` drops its pointer to this file, a sentence and no
  rule.
- **2026-09-22 — import a package for what it does.** `stack/go.md` gains one rule: no
  `reflect`, tests included; no `regexp` where `strings` or `strconv` will do; outside
  the approved table, one small function from a permissively licensed module is copied
  with its full license notice; crypto, escaping, and parsers never are. The *Context*
  and *Zero values* bullets, which a competent Go engineer already follows, are cut
  against it.
- **Both entries together, measured against v4.6.0:** the change path 8,000 → 7,985,
  every floor +10 or +11.

## Why the CSP is what it is

The standing record behind [patterns/security-headers.md](patterns/security-headers.md).
That document owns the policy and every rule; this section owns the argument, so an agent
following the policy never pays for it and an agent changing the policy can check its
work. **Add a row here when the policy changes.**

Every feature in the baseline, and what it needs:

| Feature | Needs | Covered by |
|---|---|---|
| htmx | `script-src 'self'` | `default-src`; htmx is self-hosted, no inline JS ([stack/htmx.md](stack/htmx.md)). |
| htmx indicators | nothing | htmx would inject an inline `<style>`, which `default-src 'self'` blocks. The canonical layout sets `"includeIndicatorStyles":false` and `app.css` owns those rules ([stack/css.md](stack/css.md)). |
| Mask icons | `img-src data:` | The one directive a default policy would get wrong. |
| Self-hosted font | nothing | Same-origin `.woff2` ([patterns/css-typography.md](patterns/css-typography.md)). A third-party font host would need a `font-src` hole — one reason there isn't one. |
| Web app manifest | nothing | `manifest-src` falls back to `default-src`, and the manifest is same-origin ([patterns/pwa.md](patterns/pwa.md)). |
| View transitions, CSS motion | nothing | Pure CSS ([patterns/css-motion.md](patterns/css-motion.md)). |
| Forms | `form-action 'self'` | Already in the policy. |
| Uploaded pictures | nothing | An attachment is served by the app's own handler, so `img-src 'self'` already covers it ([patterns/go-file-uploads.md](patterns/go-file-uploads.md)). What keeps that safe is not the policy but the pair of rules in that document: the type comes from sniffing the bytes, and `nosniff` makes it binding. A project that ever serves user files from a second origin needs a row here and a directive to match. |

Why each absent header stays absent:

- **`X-Frame-Options`** — superseded by `frame-ancestors`, honored by every browser in
  the support window. Two headers saying one thing is one more to keep in sync.
- **`Permissions-Policy`** — it disables browser APIs only JavaScript can call, and this
  baseline ships none ([stack/html.md](stack/html.md)).
- **`object-src 'none'`** — `default-src 'self'` already denies cross-origin plugin
  content, and the app embeds none.
- **CSP reporting (`report-to`)** — needs an endpoint and somebody to read it. Add it
  when a real policy question needs real data.

## Waived budgets

Every size budget this repository is deliberately over, and what pays it back.
[README.md](README.md) *Size budgets* makes a budget a shape rule, waivable on the record
like any other, with the record kept here because the cost lands on this repository rather
than on a project built from it. Each entry carries the six fields a waiver carries
anywhere: the rule, the document, the date, who decided, why, and what contains it.

**Nothing waived.** The one entry that stood here — the checklist and change-path budgets,
first waived 2026-08-17 for the authorization section and re-measured 2026-08-17 when four
patterns landed — was closed on 2026-08-18 by moving the two numbers instead. The decision
is recorded under *Budget decisions* below, along with the rule that governs the next one.

**`make tokens` stays red while an entry sits here, and that is the point.** The red run is
the reminder, exactly as a `Last verified:` date past ninety days is the reminder. The way
to clear it is the work under *Paid back by*, or a deliberate move of the number in a commit
that moves nothing else — never an edit folded into the change that blew the budget, which
turns a waiver into a new normal with nobody deciding to.

**A waiver's numbers are measured last, or they describe a repository that no longer
exists.** The closed entry's first draft said 4,420 and 197; two fix passes later both were
wrong, and the same entry went stale a second time mid-run. Measure after the last fix of
the run, never carry a number over from the first draft.

## Budget decisions

Why a budget number is the number it is. A number here moves only in a commit that moves
nothing else — [README.md](README.md) *Size budgets* carries that rule; this is where the
argument behind each move lives.

### 2026-08-18 — the floor, raised so the corpus can keep growing

**Decided by Andy.** The floor 19,500 → **25,000**. The per-document budget (3,800), the
checklist (5,000), and the change path (8,000) did not move.

**The collision.** The entry below closed with the floor at 19,499 of 19,500 and said the
quiet part out loud: *the floor is the number that hurts, and it is the last one that
should ever move*. Thirteen tokens is not headroom, it is a stop, and the next rule proved
it. Building a voice assistant turned up a shape the corpus had no document for — work a
request starts and does not wait for, where `srv.Shutdown` waits for in-flight requests and
silently drops the goroutine that outlived one. It landed in
[patterns/go-background-work.md](patterns/go-background-work.md), which had 3,218 tokens
spare and needed no new file. Its trigger section did not: widening the schedule section in
`checklists/web-application.md` cost 61 tokens, the checklist absorbed it fine at 4,749 of
5,000, and the floor went 48 over — because the checklist sits inside the floor. The rule
that was meant to pay for it, move a document off *Required reading*, had nothing to move.
All seven of them change a decision made before the first line of code, which is the test
that list applies.

**Why raising was the right branch.** Three alternatives, each worse. *Trim 192 bytes from
the floor path* pays for one rule by cutting prose already at the bar *Write to the reader's
competence* sets, and buys nothing for the rule after it. *Ship the document with no trigger
section* is the failure [README.md](README.md) names outright — a document no box ever
checks is how a rule goes missing, and it is why routing and the definition of done became
one file. *Hold 19,500 and stop adding rules to the web-application path* caps the corpus's
growth on purpose, which is the one thing this repository exists not to do.

**What the number buys, and what it does not.** 5,452 tokens of headroom, against a floor
that grows about 125 tokens per new trigger section — roughly forty more before this
returns. The overshoot is deliberate: 19,700 would have cleared today's red and been full
again by the next rule, which is how a gate gets retired by making it normal to ignore.
What it does not buy is a cheaper read. An agent may now pay 25,000 tokens before its first
line of code, and whether it should is a judgement this budget no longer makes for anybody.
The two rules that kept the floor small still stand and are now the whole defence:
*Required reading* takes a document only if it changes a decision made before the first
line of code, and everything else is a trigger section.

**What would make this number wrong.** If the floor climbs toward 25,000 on trigger
sections rather than on *Required reading*, the checklist-inside-the-floor coupling is the
defect and not the number — the fix is the branch the entry below deferred: budget the
shared head, cap each trigger section. If an agent's output gets worse or slower as the
floor grows, the floor is too high whatever `make tokens` says, and the reach report is
where to look — rank by size times how often a document is read, and move the heaviest
*Required reading* entry to a trigger.

**A third path this entry missed.** `SKILL.md` and `VERSIONS.md` sit inside the floor
*and* inside the change path, and neither has a per-document budget: `make tokens` caps
`patterns/`, `stack/`, and `checklists/` and nothing else. The *Required reading* test does
not govern them either — they are the head every path starts from, not entries on a list.
`ebfc5e7` added *Handing the work back* to `SKILL.md` and spent 265 of this headroom, 5% of
it, one commit after the number moved. A per-document cap on the head is the branch not
taken: two documents do not need a gate, and the floor already bounds them together.
Naming it is the fix — growth in the head is a judgement, and it now has to be made out
loud.

### 2026-08-18 — the checklist and change-path numbers, raised once

**Decided by Andy.** `checklists/*.md` 4,300 → **5,000**, and the change path 7,000 →
**8,000**. The per-document budget (3,800) and the floor (19,500) did not move.

**The collision.** [README.md](README.md) *Maintenance protocol* promises that every
recurring decision becomes a pattern, and *Writing a checklist* will not let a pattern ship
without a trigger section — so each pattern costs the change path about 125 tokens, forever.
A fixed change budget and that promise cannot both hold. v3.8.0 waived the two budgets for
the authorization section; v3.9.0's four patterns re-measured them at 4,509 and 7,237 and
found the waiver had no way to close. A 509-token trim had already taken the prose to the
bar *Write to the reader's competence* sets, and what was left was boxes and one-line
section leads, where cutting deletes checks rather than words.

**Why raising was the right branch.** Three alternatives, each worse. *Budget the shape,
report the total* — a cap on the shared head and a cap per trigger section, the way reach is
already handled — dissolves the collision permanently, but leaves the most-paid path in the
corpus with no ceiling at all. *Hold 4,300 and make a new section pay for itself by retiring
an old one* caps the corpus's growth on purpose, which is the one thing this repository
exists not to do. *Leave the waiver standing* keeps `make tokens` red indefinitely, which
retires the gate by making it normal to ignore.

**What the numbers buy, and what they do not.** 491 tokens of checklist headroom and 763 of
change-path headroom: about six more patterns at the measured 125 apiece. This branch defers
the collision rather than dissolving it, and after those six it returns. That is the honest
cost, and it was chosen with it: four patterns in one release is not yet a growth curve, and
the shape budget is a bigger change to make on one release's evidence.

**The floor did not move, and it has one token of headroom.** 19,499 of 19,500 — and the
checklist sits inside the floor, so the next trigger section blows it by about 125 even
though the checklist itself now has room. That is not an oversight in this decision; it is
the floor's existing rule doing its job. Anything added to what an agent pays before its
first line of code gets paid for out of the same path, and the next pattern to land here
pays about 125 tokens somewhere among the seven required documents. The floor is the number
that hurts, and it is the last one that should ever move.

**What would make these numbers wrong.** If the change path passes 8,000 while the checklist
is still under 5,000, the shared head or `SKILL.md` grew rather than the corpus — trim, do
not raise. Both going over together is the growth curve arriving, and that is the signal to
take the branch not taken above rather than to raise a third time.

**Since then, and the head took nearly half of it.** The 763 is spent: **7,939 of 8,000**
on 2026-08-25, 61 left. [checklists/web-application.md](checklists/web-application.md)
took 486 of it, `SKILL.md` 380, and `VERSIONS.md` gave 165 back when v4.0.0 dropped the CI
rows — 701, against the 702 the path itself grew, because `make tokens` divides the whole
path's bytes once and not each file's. Only 179 of the 486 was a new pattern —
[patterns/go-data-deletion.md](patterns/go-data-deletion.md) in `9c0be4a`, the one of the
six the headroom was raised to buy that actually landed. The other 307 is catch-up and
boxes: sections at v3.11.0 for two patterns that had landed a release earlier — background
work, and the streaming rules — and the `make ci` boxes at v4.0.0, which have no pattern
behind them at all. Against the sections measured — 61 for background work in `34ab524`,
179 here, 201 for authorization in `64babfb` — the 125 this entry budgets by is an average
nobody pays, not a rate.

**The head took 380 of it, which is *A third path this entry missed* firing.** Both edits
landed in `SKILL.md`, which no per-document budget caps and no *Required reading* test
governs: *Handing the work back* at 266 — 265 as that paragraph counted it, the same
rounding — and the gap bullet at 116. The floor pays for both too — 19,973 → 20,089 of
25,000. The judgement that paragraph asked to be made out loud, made: the bullet is worth
116 because a gap nobody writes down is a gap found again by the next project, and it is
the last thing this path can carry. *What would make these numbers wrong* names this cause
exactly, and its threshold has not been crossed — 7,939 is under 8,000 — so the reading is
*trim, do not raise*. Which trim, or the shape budget instead, is a decision rather than a
measurement, and the next pattern waits on it: 61 tokens buys no trigger section, least of
all a 179-token one.

**Settled since.** v4.3.0 took the trim branch; v4.6.0 left the path at 8,000 of 8,000;
the changes under *Owed* free 15. The next pattern still needs a budget decision first.

## Where the numbers come from

`VERSIONS.md` carries its own dated source list. Re-verify against those links,
never against memory or training data — and never against a search result that
